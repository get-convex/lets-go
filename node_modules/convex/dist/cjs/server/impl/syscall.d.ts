 * Perform a syscall, taking in a JSON-encodable object as an argument, serializing with

 * value. If one of your arguments is a Convex value, you must call `convexToJson` on it
 * before passing it to this function, and if the return value has a Convex value, you're
 * also responsible for calling `jsonToConvex`: This layer only deals in JSON.
