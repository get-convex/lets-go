# Convex

**Convex is the global state management platform for web developers.**

Convex makes it dead simple to store your app's shared state and sync it
everywhere. As a developer, you interact with your shared state using JavaScript
or TypeScript functions and bind that state to your reactive app.

Realtime updates are automatic. Every user everywhere sees the current version
of your state.

Convex is fully serverless and automatically handles caching and scaling.

**Get started at [docs.convex.dev](https://docs.convex.dev)!**

This package includes several separate entry points for building apps on Convex:

- [`convex/server`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server): Helpers for
  implementing Convex query and mutation functions.
- [`convex/react`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react): Hooks and a
  `ConvexReactClient` for integrating Convex into React applications.
- [`convex/browser`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/browser): A
  `ConvexHttpClient` for using Convex in other browser environments.
- [`convex/values`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values): Utilities for
  working with values stored in Convex.
- [`convex/react-auth0`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values): A React
  component for authenticating users with Auth0.

This package also includes [`convex`](https://docs.convex.dev/using/cli), a
command-line interface for managing Convex deployments.
